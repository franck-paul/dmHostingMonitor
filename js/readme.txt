JustGage jQuery plugin.

See: http://www.justgage.com/

JustGage is released under MIT license. Feel free to use it and modify it in any way you find suitable.

In theory, it's supposed to work in any browser supporting SVG. In practice, it was tested compatible with Chrome 20, Firefox 12, IE6, 7, 8, 9, Opera 12, Safari 5.1.2, Android 4.0.

Safari and IE users will have to excuse me, for their browser still does not support SVG filters needed to render shadow. And there's some jerkiness when animating in Opera (it's due to SVG implementation). Meh.

And it can even be made working on older Androids but hey - you don't really expect me to do all the heavy lifting, do you?

So, if you feel like justGage has been useful to you, or youâ€™d like to see more features, buy me a coffee so I can stay awake and do more cool stuff.

Throw comments, questions, eggs and tomatoes @Toorshia.
